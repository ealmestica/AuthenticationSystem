# IT 145 Final Project - Zoo AuthenticationSystem

Based on the stated problem statement and the data files provided for authentication and for the different profile roles, I have implemented the following procedure to develop the authorization system: 

1. Created a user-friendly option menu that allows the user the choice to log in with their credentials or log off to exit the program.  

2. Created an input line to prompt the user for a username.

3. Created an input line to prompt the user for a password.

4. Added the existing MD5 hash code to convert the password using a message digest five (MD5) hash.
